    <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the worldOwing to the relative ease and 
      low cost of raising chickens—in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat and 
      chicken eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisines.
        Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, 
        frying, and boiling. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become 
        a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful 
        than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.The poultry
         farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world.
          In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods
           while less-developed areas raise chickens using more 
         traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion 
            chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to oneIn factory farming, chickens are routinely
             administered with the feed additive Roxarsone, an organoarsenic compound which
              partially decomposes into inorganic arsenic compounded in the flesh of chickens,
              and in their feces, which are often used as a fertilizer.[22] The compound is
              used to control stomach pathogens and promote growth. In a 2013 sample conducted by the Johns
               Hopkins School of Public Health of chicken meat from poultry producers that
                did not prohibit roxarsone, 70% of the samples in the US had levels which exceeded
                 the safety limits as set by the FDA.[23] The FDA has since revised its stance on safe limits
                to inorganic arsenic in animal feed by stating that
             "any new animal drug that contributes to the overall inorganic arsenic burden is of potential concern"In random surveys of chicken products across the United States in 2012, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine found 48% of samples to contain fecal matter. On most commercial chicken farms, the chickens spend their entire life standing in, lying on, and living in their own manure, which is somewhat mixed in with the bedding material (e.g., sawdust, wood shavings, chopped straw, etc.).

             During shipping from the concentrated animal feeding operation farm to the abattoir, the chickens are usually placed inside shipping crates that usually have slatted floors. Those crates are then piled 5 to 10 rows high on the transport truck to the abattoir. During shipment, the chickens tend to defecate, and that chicken manure tends to sit inside the crowded cages, contaminating the feathers and skin of the chickens, or rains down upon the chickens and crates on the lower levels of the transport truck. By the time the truck gets to the abattoir, most chickens have had their skin and feathers contaminated with feces.
             
             There is also fecal matter in the intestines. While the slaughter process removes the feathers and intestines, only visible fecal matter is removed.[30] The high speed automated processes at the abattoir are not designed to remove this fecal contamination on the feather and skin. The high speed processing equipment tend to spray the contamination around to the birds going down the processing line, and the equipment on the line itself. At one or more points on most abattoirs, chemical sprays and baths (e.g., bleach, acids, peroxides, etc.) are used to partially rinse off or kill this bacterial contamination. Unfortunately, the fecal contamination, once it has occurred, especially in the various membranes between the skin and muscle, is impossible to completely remove.
             
             With slaughter lines processing up to 140 birds per minute, safety inspectors do not have adequate time to properly examine visible fecal matter.[31] The USDA is currently allowing some abattoirs to process at unlimited line speeds (i.e., in excess of 140 birds per minute), further exacerbating the fecal contamination issue..</p></div>
